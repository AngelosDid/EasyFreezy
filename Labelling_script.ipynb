This means that if you have set a different starting point in the TrimFrames() of the freezing-detection script or in the DLC itself, the values that will be pasted to each frame won't correspond with the real values anymore. If you want to use a trimmed output file that doesn't start from frame 0, you'll have to trimm your selected video to the exact right point in terms of frames for that.\n",
